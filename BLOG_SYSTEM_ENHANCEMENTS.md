### Error Handling Strategy

The enhanced error handling strategy follows these principles:

- Early detection of malformed/incomplete data
- Graceful fallbacks for missing fields
- Clear error messages in the console for debugging
- Non-breaking UI even when data is incomplete

## Future Improvements
