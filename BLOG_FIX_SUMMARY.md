# Blog Page Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The Ekko Labs portfolio website's blog page was not loading correctly due to issues with the `calculateReadTime` function usage in the blog components.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The `calculateReadTime` function was referenced in `BlogList.tsx` but not imported
2. A previous fix attempted to hardcode the read time as "2 min read" but didn't properly handle content length calculation
3. The `normalizePost` function from blog-utils.ts wasn't being used, instead a local implementation was created

## Solution Implemented

We implemented an inline content-aware read time calculation directly in the `normalizePost` function in `BlogList.tsx`:

```typescript
readTime: post.readTime || (post.content ? `${Math.max(1, Math.ceil(post.content.trim().split(/\s+/).length / 225))} min read` : "2 min read"),
```

This solution:

1. Uses the existing `readTime` value if provided by the API
2. Otherwise calculates read time based on word count in the content (using 225 words per minute as standard)
3. Provides a fallback of "2 min read" if no content is available
4. Avoids TypeScript errors by not relying on undefined imports

## Verification

The changes were tested locally and deployed to Vercel to ensure functionality in the production environment.

## Next Steps

While this fix addresses the immediate issue with the blog page loading, a more comprehensive solution would be to:

1. Fix the TypeScript linting errors in the codebase
2. Centralize the blog utility functions to avoid duplication
3. Improve the testing coverage for the blog components

These improvements can be addressed in a future iteration to make the codebase more maintainable and robust.
