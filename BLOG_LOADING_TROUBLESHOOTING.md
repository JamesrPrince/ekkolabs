# Blog Page Loading Troubleshooting Process

## Issue Identification

The Ekko Labs portfolio website blog page was not loading correctly, likely due to errors in data fetching, processing, or rendering.

## Diagnostic Approach

### 1. Examined Code Structure

- Reviewed the blog page component (`BlogList.tsx`)
- Analyzed data fetching hooks (`use-blog-api.ts`)
- Reviewed API endpoints (`/api/blog.ts`)
- Checked utility functions (`blog-utils.ts`)

### 2. Identified Key Issues

1. The `calculateReadTime` function was referenced in BlogList.tsx but not properly imported
2. A previous fix attempted to bypass this by hardcoding "2 min read"
3. The `normalizePost` utility function wasn't being utilized effectively

### 3. Verified API Responses

- Confirmed that the `/api/blog/posts` endpoint was working correctly and returning data
- Verified that blog data contained all necessary fields

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Code Analysis

- Identified the problematic code section in BlogList.tsx:

```typescript
readTime: post.readTime || "2 min read",
```

### 2. Implemented Fix

- Modified the normalizePost function in BlogList.tsx to properly calculate read time:

```typescript
readTime: post.readTime || (post.content ? `${Math.max(1, Math.ceil(post.content.trim().split(/\s+/).length / 225))} min read` : "2 min read"),
```

### 3. Deployment

- Used the quick-deploy.sh script to deploy changes to Vercel
- Documented the changes and current state in BLOG_FIX_SUMMARY.md

## Validation

- Verified API endpoints were working correctly
- Deployed changes to Vercel and verified blog page functionality
- Updated documentation to reflect changes and next steps

## Lessons and Best Practices

1. Centralize utility functions to avoid duplication and maintain consistency
2. Ensure proper TypeScript typing to catch issues during development
3. Document complex processes and workarounds for future reference
4. Use incremental fixes for critical issues, followed by comprehensive refactoring
